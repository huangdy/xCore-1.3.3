README - Security
All tests run with security enabled (jetty or tomcat).

If you want to run with  security disabled, here's how:
1. In web.xml: you must comment out:
- The <filter> stanza 
- The <filter-mapping> stanza and 
- The reference to applicationContext-security.xml 
(see dist list email reference)
2. In addition, I needed to remove/rename the applicationContext-security.xml file itself, 
as it seemed to be used even though it was not referenced in web.xml. 
(It seems as though that file as being appended otherwise.) 

NOTE: I edited the files in this folder directly prior to deploying
C:\workspace\core\war\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF

Your mileage may vary.
